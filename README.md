# TaskManager

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.2.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
for running specific test files, you can use:

```bash
npx vitest run path/to/your/testfile.spec.ts
```

## Running end-to-end tests (cypress)

For end-to-end (e2e cypress) testing, run:

```bash
npx cypress run
```
 For opening the Cypress Test Runner in interactive mode, use:

```bash
npx cypress open
```
For running specific e2e test files, you can use:

```bash
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/path/to/your/testfile.cy.ts"
```
